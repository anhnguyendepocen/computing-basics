== Computing Basics

This resource contains a compilation of _basic_ things everyone should know about
computing, on various related topics.

The target audience is "non-technical", smart people
who know little or nothing about the technical details of computing, the
Internet, security, etc. or how any of it actually "works".

These "must know" basics are in documented in a https://github.com/brianhigh/computing-basics/wiki[wiki] 
and are also compiled into an ebook (https://github.com/brianhigh/computing-basics/raw/master/computing_basics.pdf[PDF] 
and https://github.com/brianhigh/computing-basics/raw/master/computing_basics.epub[EPUB]).
