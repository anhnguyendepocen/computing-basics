Computing Basics
================

A compilation of *basic* things everyone should know about computing, on various related topics.

We are compiling a list of basic "things people should know" about
computing and information technology, generally for professional and
academic careers. The target audience is "non-technical", smart people
who know little or nothing about the technical details of computing, the
Internet, security, etc. or how any of it actually "works".

Here is a tentative topic list:

* Networking
* Information Security
* Resource Management
* File and Data Formats
* File and Data Sharing
* Data Management
* Databases
* Big Data
* Cloud Computing
* Project Management
* Version Control
* Programming

Each topic will get its own page in [the wiki](https://github.com/brianhigh/computing-basics/wiki).

Once the initial compilation is made, we will likely clean up and place into individual markdown (md) files.
