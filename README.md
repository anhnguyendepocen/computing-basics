Computing Basics
================

A compilation of *basic* things everyone should know about computing, on various related topics.

We are compiling a list of basic "things people should know" about
computing and information technology, generally for professional and
academic careers. The target audience is "non-technical", smart people
who know little or nothing about the technical details of computing, the
Internet, security, etc. or how any of it actually "works".

These "must know" basics are in [the wiki](https://github.com/brianhigh/computing-basics/wiki).
